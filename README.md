# AdventureWorks-Bike-Company-Data-Modeling

##This project conducts an in-depth data modeling analysis for "Adventure Works" bicycle company, aiming to optimize data analysis and decision support processes through the construction of a star schema by using Power BI. We focused on the company's five main business processes: membership management, inventory management, manufacturing processes, purchasing, and sales activities. By transforming the original 3NF normalized tables into a star schema, we successfully simplified the data structure, enhanced the efficiency of data queries, and provided clear, intuitive data support for decision-makers.
